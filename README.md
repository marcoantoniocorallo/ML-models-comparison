# This project has been developed as part of the exam of the Machine Learning class @ [UniPi](https://di.unipi.it/)

## Objectives
The main goals of the project are
- the comparison and evaluation of different ML models implemented by different frameworks;
- the evaluation of the usability of the frameworks;
- the evaluation of the accuracy and the performances of the models;
- the identification of the best-performing model to compete in an internal competition among students.

## Tasks
The models should be applied and tested on two different tasks:
- The [Monk's Problem](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/70/monk+s+problems) to start with a simple classification task on which to apply the ML techniques learned during the course;
- A regression task known as _The Cup_: the lecturer provided us with a test set for which to estimate the target values by means of our best-performing model.

## Results
We tested and compared a long serie of different models from different Python frameworks, here you can find our NN implementations.
